Description:

Description:

    Allocates one page of hook specific memory.

Parameters:

    - InEntryPoint

        Ignored for 32-Bit versions and drivers. In 64-Bit user mode, the returned
        pointer will always be in a 31-bit boundary around this parameter. This way
        a relative jumper can still be placed instead of having to consume much more entry
        point bytes for an absolute jump!

Returns:

    NULL if no memory could be allocated, a valid pointer otherwise.
