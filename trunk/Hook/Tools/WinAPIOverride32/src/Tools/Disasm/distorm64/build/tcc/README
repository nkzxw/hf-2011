Support for Tiny C Compiler (DOS/Windows)

Set the path of TCC inside make.bat and then run it.
Since you cannot compile a library with TCC, you have to build diStorm itself with the linuxproj directly along.

Note that since TCC is buggy and is abandoned by the original author, I changed some code so it will be compiled well with the official version of TCC.
