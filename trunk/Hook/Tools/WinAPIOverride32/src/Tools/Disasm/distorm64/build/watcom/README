Support for OpenWatcom

Make sure the watcom variable, which must be set, points to the correct full path of the installed Watcom\ directory.
The make.bat will create the disasm.exe of the linux project.

I prefered to compile a library since it will make the compilation of the linux project easier. So you only have to link it with the created library. Thus it's a two-steps compilation/linkage.

It can easily be changed to support other platforms but Windows. For now I chose to omit them and try to make the support as easy as possible. If you need further help just let me know.
