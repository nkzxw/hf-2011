About Winpooch
--------------
	Winpooch is a watchdog for Windows. It watches running
programs and prevents them from doing dangerous operations. This version
of Winpooch also includes an antivirus (ClamAV) and can provide a 
real-time virus protection.


System requirements
-------------------
	Winpooch highly depends on the Windows version installed on your
computer. It should work on almost every 32-bits versions of Windows 2000, 
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
	If your version is not supported, an "incompatibility report" will
automatically be generated by Winpooch. Please follow the instructions on
the report (basically post the report), so that support for your version 
can be quickly added.

    This release include no new feature, only bug fix and compatibility
improvements.
    
    
Next evolutions
---------------
    Winpooch development is likely to be paused for a while since I'm
getting tired. Open-source development is very time-consuming and I would
like to spend my time in other things, like riding my new motorcycle...
    Other developers are trying to get involved in Winpooch development,
I hope they will manage to continue development...
