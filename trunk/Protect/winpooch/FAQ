1. Why does the main menu looks badly ?
=======================================

This may be because of your display configuration.
Are you using a 16-bits display ?
If so, you should switch to 32-bits.
Winpooch looks really better with a 32-bits resolution.


2. What is the "feign" reaction ?
=================================

When Winpooch feigns an action, it simply tell the application that 
the requested action has succeeded, but in reality no action is 
performed.

In programming terms, this means that Winpooch returns a value
indicating no error but doesn't execute the real function.
This is opposed to the "reject" feature : in this mode Winpooch
returns a value indicating an error, which means that the calling
programs knows that the function failed.

In some cases, the "feign" reaction can be the same as "reject".


3. What is the difference between types "Path" and "Wildcards" ?
================================================================

These two types are quite similar : you can use wildcards character
(? and *) with both.
The difference is that "Path" considers the parameter as a file path
(ie it takes care of slashes) whereas "Wildcards" considers the 
parameter a a plain characters string.

This difference has the following effect : "Path" don't check 
sub-directories whereas "Wildcards" check subdirectories.
Is it clear ?

No ? OK, let's take a simple example.
You want to check the following pattern :
"C:\Windows\*.dll"
but you hesitate between "Path" and "Wildcards" types.
With the "Path" type, you will only catch DLL files in the Windows
directory, like C:\Windows\Hello.dll.
With the "Wildcards" type, you will also catch DLL files in the
sub-directories, like C:\Windows\System32\Hello.dll.


4. How can I contribute to this project ?
=========================================

We are looking for :
- translators 
- testers
- doc writers
Please don't write to ask to contribute as a developer, we are not
looking for developers.

If you want to contribute as a translator or as a tester, please 
register to the corresponding mailing list and post a request for help.

If you are an experienced user of Winpooch, you can help new users
by answering questions on the mailing list "Winpooch-users".

Use this page to register to one or more list :

5. Where can I find help on Winpooch ?
======================================

We know Winpooch lacks documentations.
If you have a question about Winpooch and you can't find the answer in
this FAQ, you can submit your question to the mailing list "Winpooch-users"
at the address winpooch-users@lists.sourceforge.net


6. What if I use ProcessGuard ?
===============================

ProcessGuard is a program that also use API hooking to spy programs.
You need to configure ProcessGuard correctly to make Winpooch works
properly. Set the following configuration for Winpooch.exe :
- Uncheck "Protect this application from modification"
- Check "Authorize this application to modify protected applications"

Normally, Winpooch will detect ProcessGuard and display a warning
the first time you run it.


7. Is Windows 64 supported ?
============================

Only 32-bit versions of Windows are currently supported.
Windows 64 will be supported in the future.


8. What are the differences with another anti-spyware ?
=======================================================

Many anti-spywares work like an anti-virus : they scan the memory and
hard drives and look for know signatures. When they recognize a signature,
they consider the file to be a virus. This means that all signatures 
have to be registered in a database. If a new virus is not yet registered
in the database, it will not be detected.

Winpooch uses a completely different approach : as a watchdog, it watches
program and detect when a suspicious action is done. Winpooch uses filters
so a to prevent dangerous actions : with default filters, most of the
sensible points used by spywares are protected (mainly start-up techniques).

That's why we recommend to use an anti-virus in addition to Winpooch.
For a completely open-source security solution, you should consider to
install ClamWin + Winpooch. You can configure Winpooch so it'll use
ClamWin and scan every executable file before allowing it to run.

We also advice you to install Winpooch on a healthy computer because
Winpooch can easily prevent spywares and adwares from installing, but
can't destroy them.


9. Can Winpooch slow down my computer ?
=======================================

It's the drawback of any security system : they all slow down the computer.
Winpooch can significantly slow functions it hooks, but we chose to hook
only functions which are not time-critical.

The impact of Winpooch on the computer speed depends on the filters you
configured : the more rule there are, the slower the computer is.
That's because Winpooch needs to check each rule one-by-one, so when they
are many rule, it can be longer than when just a few rule have to be checked.

If you use an antivirus with Winpooch, it will significantly slow down your
computer (as with every antivirus) because files will be scanned on-the-fly.


10. Is Winpooch an ultimate security solution ?
===============================================

Of course not !
Winpooch can significantly improve the security of your system but there is
no ultimate security solution.

Since version 0.6.0, Winpooch become a real on-access (real-time) antivirus.
This means that each time a file is read, it is scan by the antivirus.
For now, there is no "on-write" scan, but only "on-read".

To increase security, you should update Winpooch frequently.
You should also update your antivirus.
If you use the antivirus integrated to Winpooch, its database are updated
automatically every 3 hours (of course if your internet access is working).


11. How can I uninstall Winpooch ?
==================================

To uninstall Winpooch, you need to shut it down first.
To do this, right-click on the tray icon and then click "shutdown".
Now you can uninstall it by launching the uninstaller.


12. How can I compile Winpooch ?
================================

To compile winpooch, you will need :
- MinGW environment : http://www.mingw.org/
- FreeImage library : http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/
- Libclamav library : http://www.clamav.net/
