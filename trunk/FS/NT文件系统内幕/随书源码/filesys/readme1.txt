------------------------

The sample file system driver code provided here can be used to
design and implement your own file system driver product.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The code provided here is for illustration purposes only. It is not
to be used as-is. Substantial modifications, enhancements, and testing
are required before installing any portion of the code on any machine.

DO NOT EXPECT THIS CODE TO WORK. IT IS ONLY TO BE USED AS A GUIDE
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TEXT CONTAINED IN THE BOOK IN DESIGNING YOUR
OWN FSD. IT IS SEVERELY LACKING IN FUNCTIONALITY AND HAS NEVER BEEN
INSTALLED OR TESTED AS IS COMMONLY REQUIRED.

TO COMPILE THE SOURCES PROVIDED HERE, YOU MUST HAVE A COPY OF THE
