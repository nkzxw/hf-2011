	NOTE: Currently, SFSD does not handle multiply linked files correctly.
			In your FSD implementation, you must be careful about handling
			such on-disk files correctly i.e. a single (unique) FCB must
			represent an on-disk file/directory regardless of the path used
			to access the on-disk object.
			With the current SFSD implementation, an on-disk file object
			with more than a single (hard) link will be treated incorrectly!

	Each FCB can logically be divided into two:
	(a) a structure that must have a field of type FSRTL_COMMON_FCB_HEADER
		 as the first field in the structure.
		 This portion should also contain other structures/resources required
		 by the NT Cache Manager
		 We will call this structure the "NT Required" FCB. Note that this
		 portion of the FCB must be allocated from non-paged pool.
	(b) the remainder of the FCB is dependent upon the particular FSD
		 requirements.
		 This portion of the FCB could possibly be allocated from paged
		 memory, though in the sample FSD, it will always be allocated
		 from non-paged pool.

	FCB structures are protected by the MainResource as well as the
	PagingIoResource. Of course, if your FSD implementation requires
	it, you can associate other syncronization structures with the

The following locking hierarchy is maintained in this sample filesystem
driver:

(a) the global structure resource can be acquired at any time. However,
    it is an "end resource" i.e. once acquired, no other resource can
	 be obtained until the global structure resource is released.
(b) the logical volume resource must be acquired (if required) before
	 any of the other resources are acquired.
(c) a file control block can be acquired next (if required). If two
    FCB structures need to be acquired, the FCB "higher" in the directory
	 tree must be acquired first.
	 For a FCB, the "main resource" must be acquired first before a
	 "paging i/o" resource is acquired.

Whenever a file is opened, the logical volume structure is referenced.
This ensures that the volume cannot be dismounted while any file is open.
