# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.  The INCLUDES

# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
# The SOURCES variable is required.  If there are no platform common source
# files, an empty SOURCES variable should be used. (i.e. SOURCES= )

# Source files common to multiple platforms
