Distribution date 07/17/05
NTBKUP version 1.07
MSQIC  version 1.11

This is a source code distribtion library for Windows backup
readers.  I have included a snapshot of my current
web page, msbackup.htm.  Use it as your documentation.

These will remain beta distributions.  I've done as much
testing as I can, but trying to support 3 OS leads to
too many combinations to be sure I've tested every option.
If you have a problem or bug please get in touch but
don't expect too much, my interest has dwindled.
See contact.htm.

Expand everything in a directory and try one of the make files.
I apologize for the current state of the Linux build.

msbkup.mak works with various Microsoft compilers
   as indicated in the file.  It should detect the OS.
   If you use nmake, it will probably make sense.

msbkup.lin works in my linux environment.  Its fairly
   generic if you use 'make -f msbkup.lin'
   However Berend de Boer went to the trouble of explaining
   and creating a sample autoconfigure script for me.
   I've been attempting to understand this and incorporate
   it, but time is tight and energy is low so I'm afraid
   its still not yet in this source distribution.  Sorry,
   as its the right way to do it....
