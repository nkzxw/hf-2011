<h2>Contact Info</h2>
You are welcome (encouraged) to send me personal email regarding topics discussed on
my web pages.  If you don't mind please include at least you country and possibly
you state/country/territory.  With some of my more obscure software I get mail from
all over and its interesting tracking the source.  Please send email
to the following address:<br> 
<b>will_kranz at SoftHome.net</b><p>
Sorry, you've got to cut and paste the address above.  I've
been getting way too much junk email and have been told to
remove automatic HTML addresses such as <address>
<a href="mailto:someone@somewhere.net">someone</a></address> because
automated systems scan web pages looking for these.  My user name and
server above are separated by the string " at " which must be replace by '@'
to create a valid address.  Sorry to
make you do a little extra work, but maybe this will cut down
on the amount of spam I recieve.<p>

<h1>WARNING</h1>
If you are emailing me some solicitation I have not requested, please
don't.  I've registered with Junkbusters and will attempt to
charge people who do send me unsolicited solicitations.  See the
registered <a href="spamoff.htm">terms and conditions</a>
under which I will accept unsolicited email of this nature.<p>
You won't find my phone number or postal address on these pages,
but I feel the same way about <a href="junkdec.htm">
telephone and mail solicitations</a>.
